# CIS400-Project
I am Chenmeinian Guo, and I am responsible for part 4: Data Analysis. This repository contains my codes.
I uploaded two of the datasets I mentioned in report: tweetemotion.csv (as a zip file because it is larger than 50 MB and I have to compress it) and userinfo.csv.
However, I could not upload tweetsentiments.csv because even after compressing it, it's still larger than 50 MB. If you need that file, feel free to contact me.
